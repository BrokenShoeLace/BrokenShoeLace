- 👋 Hi, I am @BrokenShoeLace
- 👀 I’m interested in web design, programming with Visual Studio and tools like Powershell etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to cope with my addiction to licking windows
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on dotnet, web, desktop or networking apps and documentation
- 📫 How to reach me: if you're close enough by tapping me on the shoulder. Don't forget your Covid mask.
